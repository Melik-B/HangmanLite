Hello, this simple console project you have seen is a hangman game, by looking at this project you can improve yourself on issues such as list random or conditions.

  k*l********

<b>ALGORITHM</b>

- A random word is chosen from the word list.
- The randomly selected word is printed on the screen in encrypted form.
- The user's life is printed on the screen.
- The user's life depends on the length of the word.
- The user is prompted to enter a letter.
- If the letter entered by the user is not in the word, the user's life will decrease.
- Go to step 1.5.
- If the letter entered by the user is in the word, that letter is opened in the word.
- If the user knows the whole word, "Congratulations, you know." is printed.
- If the user does not know the word, "You didn't know, try again" is printed on the screen.
